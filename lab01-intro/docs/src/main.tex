\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this experiment is to serve as a practical introduction to Matlab and Simulink and their graphical user interface.

Matlab is a linear algebra tool, and Simulink is a tool for modeling systems using block diagrams.
They may each be used for modeling control systems among other types of systems.

In this example, we use Matlab to model a polynomial as a row vector of coefficients. We also use Matlab in conjunction with Simulink to prepare, model and contrast $2$ control systems.
